    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <p>Weâ€™ve included a good mix of entirely new recipes, like our shakshuka stuffed peppers, our slow-cooker shrimp boil, and our Mexican street corn chicken skillet, as well as some old favorites, like our zucchini grilled cheese, our Big Mac hot dogs, and our BBQ protein bowls. Looking for an easy weeknight dinner you can eat al fresco? Our honey-chipotle salmon foil packs, our fish tacos, grilled chicken breasts, and our shrimp po' boy burgers are just the thing.

        Feeling the back to school crunch? Comforting, filling, quick & easy pastas should be on your weeknight menu. Our cherry tomato pasta, our one-pan eggplant Parm orzo, our baked feta pasta, and our sun-dried tomato pasta come together fast, are full of flavor, and make for pretty tasty leftovers too.</p>
